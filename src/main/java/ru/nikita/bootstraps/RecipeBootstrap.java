                "3 Cut the cornbread into cubes and toast: Use a serrated knife to cut the cornbread into roughly 1/2-inch cubes. Be gently as you slice to avoid crumbling the cubes. You should have about 8 cups cubed.\n" +
                "Transfer the cubes and any crumbs the baking sheet used to toast the pecans. Toast for 15 to 20 minutes, stirring partway through, until the cubes look golden around the edges and feel dry to the touch.\n" +

                "Add the sage, parsley, thyme, salt, pepper, olives, and cranberries. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes longer, or until the vegetables soften and the herbs are very aromatic. Let cool for 10 minutes.\n" +

                "In a small bowl, whisk the eggs, stock and cream together. Pour over the stuffing and toss gently to combine, using your hands if necessary to avoid crumbling the cornbread too much. The stuffing should feel evenly moist; sprinkle with additional chicken stock as needed.\n" +
